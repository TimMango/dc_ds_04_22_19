Correlation is bounded between -1 and 1 and can be compared across all variables, with values near -1 or 1 indicating a strong relationship.  Values near 1 have a strong positive correlation, values near -1 have a strong negative correlation.  Covariance provides a measurement that is similar to correlation, but covariance has different units of measurement.  Different variables have different covariance unites and measurements are difficult to use for comparison unless they are transformed."
